An experimental, early-stage, pre-alpha project. Sponsor us now to try out early access to features and be our QA tester, and extra benefits in the discord channel! ❤️

“prosody” is effectively a graph database - a knowledge graph - which

a) gets updated in real time via an IRC protocol (so it’s like a chat-graph-wiki, the best of all three worlds)

b) is coded in ieml, a formally-constructed language

c) works via locally hosted graphs, in a *data mesh* (more to come on that soon)

It is heavily if not profoundly influenced by IEML by Pierre Levy, blockchain, formal verification languages, and ologs (ontology logs) by David Spivak, as well as taking a leaf the UI of Discord, and the power of and fascination with LLMs.)
